# Voxy Extra

Voxy Extra is a Voxy addon, which adds features that shouldn't be in Voxy. It may be out of scope features, bad design features, etc.

# Features

Current list of implemented features:
 - Nether Fog Fix: Disables nether fog with environmental fog enabled;
 - Copying LoDs with Flashback replays: Allows to show proper LoD state in old replays, also enabling ingesting (eats your disk yummy).

All features are configurable in Sodium options.

# Suggestions

If you have any idea for Voxy, which is out of scope for sure, feel free to suggest it here: [Issues](https://github.com/ImGRUI/voxy-extra/issues).
