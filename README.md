# Voxy Extra

Voxy Extra is a Voxy addon, which adds features that shouldn't be in Voxy. It may be out of scope features, bad design features, etc.

# Features

Current list of implemented features:
 - Nether Fog Fix: Disables nether fog with environmental fog enabled;
 - Copying LoDs with Flashback replays: Allows to show proper LoD state in old replays, also enabling ingesting (eats your disk yummy);
 - Server Blacklist: Allows disabling Voxy on specific servers;
 - LoD Mirror: Allows setting one LoD storage for multiple IP addresses.

All features are configurable in Sodium options (besides lists).
